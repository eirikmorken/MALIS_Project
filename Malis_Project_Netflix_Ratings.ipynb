    "## Netflix movie Rating predictor\n",

    "in this notebook the MALIS project by Eirik Morken en Gijs Wissing will be described.\n",
    "The goal of our project was to predict the personal rating Gijs would give to a unseen movie based on his Netflix Viewing history and other open data from sources like IMDB. The biggest challenge of this project is dealing with unlabeled data, as Gijs did not provide any ratings to the movies he has viewed on Netflix. Having unlabeled data is a very common real world problem for data scientists. The way it was solved in this project was using a unsupervised clustering algorithm as well as a cusotm made voting system."

    "#### The Data\n",
    "To start the project all the necessary data had to be put together. This provided an initial challenge as the dataset from IMDB is larger than the RAM in our machines can handle directly. On top of this the labels used between IMDB and Netflix are completely different. For this reason we used some iterative line processors to integrate the IMDB data into our working dataset. Below you will find a cell showing an example of one of these line processors. No further code will used during in this notebook as the importing, filtering and cleaning of the data is quite a time-consuming process. For that reason beyond this point a saved cleaned dataset will be imported."
